  Commons Email uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven 2.0</a>

<section name="Maven Goals">
  <p>
    To build a jar file, change into Email's root directory and run "mvn package".
    The result will be in the "target" subdirectory.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build the Javadocs, run "mvn javadoc:javadoc".
    The result will be in "target/docs/apidocs".
  </p>
  <p>
    To build the full website, run "mvn site".
    The result will be in "target/site".
    You must be using JDK 1.4 or higher to successfully complete this target.
  </p>

<section name="Development">
  <p>
    Commons Email may be used on any JRE from 1.4 onwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Commons Email requires <a href="http://subethasmtp.tigris.org/wiser.html">Wiser</a>
    for its unit tests. The base distribution requires JDK 1.5, but 1.4-compatible
    jars are also provided in the binary distribution
    <a href="http://subethasmtp.tigris.org/files/documents/4046/36703/subethasmtp-1.2.zip">here</a>.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, you will also need to install the Retroweaver runtime support
    library on behalf of Wiser. That download is available
    <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/retroweaver/retroweaver-2.0.zip">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    These jars will be automatically installed to your local Maven 2 repository
    if you build using Maven.
